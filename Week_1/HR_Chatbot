## 💡 Key Learnings

### How RAG Works (Best Summary)

When you upload files to a custom GPT and enable knowledge retrieval, the following happens behind the scenes:

1. **Chunking:** Files are automatically broken into smaller sections (e.g., paragraphs or logical blocks)
2. **Embedding:** Each chunk is converted into an embedding using OpenAI's embedding models
3. **Storage:** The embeddings are stored in OpenAI's internal vector store
4. **Querying:** When a user asks a question, the GPT creates a vector for the prompt and retrieves semantically similar chunks
5. **Response generation:** The retrieved chunks are included as context in the GPT's prompt to generate a more informed answer

## 🔧 Challenges & Lessons Learned

### 1. API Key Management
Had difficulty hiding the API key properly. Encountered authentication errors like:
```
anthropic.AuthenticationError: Error code: 401 - {'type': 'error', 
'error': {'type': 'authentication_error', 'message': 'invalid x-api-key'}}
```
**Lesson:** Always use `.env` files locally and platform secrets (like Streamlit Cloud's Secrets) for deployment. Never commit API keys to GitHub.

### 2. UI/UX is a Separate Skill
Managing the chatbot UI turned into its own project. Required learning CSS for custom styling (gradients, chat bubbles, colors).

**Lesson:** Good UX is critical — no one will use a chatbot if the interface is poor. Will practice more CSS later.

### 3. Dependency Management
Several sessions were spent just loading initial files and managing dependencies. New tools mean new errors.

**Lesson:** When learning something new, take breaks. Overworking leads to missing obvious errors. Fresh eyes help.

### 4. GitHub Push Issues
Encountered `remote rejected - push declined due to repository rule violations` when accidentally trying to push files containing API keys.

**Lesson:** Set up `.gitignore` BEFORE the first commit.

## 🎯 Reflection

Overall, I was happy with my progress this week. I successfully built and deployed my first RAG chatbot, which was the main goal. The project taught me not just about LLMs and embeddings, but also about the full deployment pipeline — from local development to cloud hosting.

I'm also glad I started working on DataCamp. I feel like I'm on the right path and will learn a lot.

**I'm excited. Cheers to my upcoming learning! 🎉**
